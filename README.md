\
**"From the stardust of RFO BASIC, new applications are born in the Nebula."**

This is the Home of Project Nebula, a Runtime Environment written in and based on RFO BASIC! 

## Overview

Project Nebula is an ambitious, evolving runtime engine specifically designed for **RFO BASIC!**. Much like the iconic telescope and stars that represent RFO BASIC's APK Icon, and in homage to its "creator" Paul Laughton, Nebula serves as the cosmic nursery where RFO BASIC applications can be conceived, developed, and brought to life.

Our vision is to create a powerful, integrated environment that expands the capabilities of RFO BASIC, making it easier to build more complex and robust applications on Android. Project Nebula is being constructed in "pillars," distinct phases that progressively integrate essential functionalities into a single, cohesive APK.

## Core Philosophy

Inspired by the cosmos, Project Nebula aims to be:

* **Expansive:** Continuously growing to incorporate new features and capabilities.
* **Structured:** Built upon well-defined "pillars" for clarity and phased development.
* **Creative:** Fostering an environment where RFO BASIC developers can bring their most ambitious ideas to fruition.
* **Community-Driven:** While currently under development, we look forward to community involvement in shaping Nebula's future.

## Current Pillars of Development

Project Nebula is currently integrating the following core components:

1.  **üåå Memory Manager:**
    * **Purpose:** To provide more sophisticated and efficient memory handling for RFO BASIC applications. This pillar focuses on redesigning the way "pointers" are thought of in RFO BASIC and introduce a new system altogether, **Memory Addresses.**
    * **Status:** [Current Release: Version 0.20]

2.  **üå† rfOOP (Object Oriented Data Structures):**
    * **Purpose:** To introduce and seamlessly integrate object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms into RFO BASIC. This will allow developers to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code by leveraging concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
    * **Status:** [Pre-Release]

3.  **üåü Engine Core:**
    * **Purpose:** The heart of Project Nebula, this pillar focuses on enhancing the core execution capabilities of RFO BASIC. It aims to improve performance, extend the language's built-in functionalities, and provide a more robust runtime environment.
    * **Status:** [Pre-Release]

4.  **üõ∞Ô∏è Code Editor:**
    * **Purpose:** An integrated code editor tailored for RFO BASIC, designed to streamline the development process. Features may include syntax highlighting, debugging aids, and project management tools, all accessible within the Nebula environment.
    * **Status:** [Pre-Release]

5.  **üì° Web Server:**
    * **Purpose:** To enable RFO BASIC applications to easily host and manage web content or create local network services. This opens up possibilities for remote control, data sharing, and building interactive web interfaces for RFO BASIC projects.
    * **Status:** [Pre-Release]

6.  **üì¶ Package Manager:**
    * **Purpose:** To simplify the discovery, installation, and management of RFO BASIC libraries, extensions, or even pre-packaged Nebula components. This will allow developers to easily extend their projects with community-contributed or officially curated packages, fostering a richer ecosystem around RFO BASIC and Project Nebula.
    * **Status:** [Planned Phase]

## The Vision: A Unified APK

The ultimate goal of Project Nebula is to merge these pillars into a single Android Application Package (APK). This unified environment will provide RFO BASIC developers with a comprehensive suite of tools and an enhanced runtime, simplifying development and deployment.

## Getting Started

*(This section will be updated as Project Nebula reaches a more mature state. For now, it's a placeholder for how users will eventually interact with or use Nebula.)*

Currently, Project Nebula is in a Early Alpha State. As components become stable, we will provide instructions on how to:

* Download and install Project Nebula.
* Utilize the integrated features.
* Develop applications within the Nebula environment.

## Future Goals

Beyond the current pillars, we envision:

* A full replacement for the traditional RFO Basic Package
* Comprehensive documentation for all Nebula components.
* Tutorials and example projects.

## Contributing

While Project Nebula is currently driven by a core vision, we anticipate opening up avenues for community contributions in the future. This could include:

* Bug reporting and testing.
* Feature suggestions.
* Theory Crafting

Stay tuned for more information on how you can become a part of Project Nebula's journey!
